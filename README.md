A project built with firebase and google maps to help track student demographics. The purpose for this project was to help the admissions counselors at my university track where prospective students are coming from. The inspiration for this project came from seeing that admissions team had hundreds of data items in an excel spreadsheet that tracked where students were from, but it was difficult to see exactly where the counselors should go to recruit. This map makes it easy for the admissions team to simply log where the students are from, and see it dynamically appear on the map.
